# basic_algorithms

## What am I looking at?

This is my set of implented basic algorithms. Mainly (at this time) written in C++ but it is possible I will do some of them in other programming languages. :)

## But why?

Some of these were used in my projects, some were implemented just because I was fascinated by their beauty and I had to try it!

## Can I use them?

Sure! Feel free to take them, use them or edit them. :)
